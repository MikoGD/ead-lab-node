# EAD Lab 3

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab was to create a node server and serve static files and data. The static files are client side
code. The data is data on countries to create a unique table from the 6 json files about countries. This country data
must be requested through AJAX. jQuery is also a requirement for this lab. I used this lab to further my understanding
of redux and webpack. The use of TypeScript, webpack and redux was not necessary.

## How to run the server

- Install Node.JS and NPM
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to build the project
- Run `npm run run_server` to start the server
- Navigate to localhost:3000 to open the web page
